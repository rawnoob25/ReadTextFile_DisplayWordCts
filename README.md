## This repo contains files that show how to use javascript to read from a text file, and to display counts of words in the text file (in descending order of frequency). 

In particular, **createTextFile.py** creates a textfile of random words. **text.html**
is the html file for the page. **style.css** is the associated stylesheet and **text.js**
is the javascript file.
